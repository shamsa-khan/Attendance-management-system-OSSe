The Attendance Management System is a software developed for daily student attendance in university. It facilitates to access the attendance information of a particular student in a particular class. The information is sorted by the operators, which will be provided by the teacher for a particular class. This system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. 
Attendance management has always been a challenge for colleges, with traditional methods like manual registers proving to be inefficient and time-consuming. An Attendance Management System can automate the process, making it easier and more accurate. The main aim of proposed system is to maintain attendance record of the students for a university. This will eliminate the need for manual registers and reduce the possibility of proxy attendance. 
ATTENDENCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (AMS) has four user module to run the system i.e. Admin, Staff, Student and Guardian.
